# Chicago Restaurant Hybrid Recommender System

This project features a hybrid recommender system built to provide personalized restaurant recommendations based on the **Entree Chicago Recommendation Data** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The system predicts user preferences by combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to deliver more accurate and relevant suggestions.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project was to address the challenge of information overload in a dense urban environment like Chicago. By leveraging user interaction data and restaurant attributes, the system helps users discover restaurants that align with their tastes, even if they have a limited history on the platform. The hybrid model is specifically designed to tackle the "cold start" problem, offering meaningful recommendations to new users.

The recommender system was developed in Python, using `scikit-learn` for modeling and `pandas` for data manipulation.

## Key Features

* **Collaborative Filtering:** A user-based collaborative filtering model was implemented to find similar users and recommend restaurants that those users have rated highly. This model uses matrix factorization techniques to uncover latent preferences from historical user ratings.
* **Content-Based Filtering:** The system analyzes restaurant features (e.g., cuisine type, price range, location) to recommend establishments similar to those a user has previously enjoyed. This method is crucial for recommending new or less-rated restaurants.
* **Hybrid Recommendation Engine:** The final recommendations are generated by combining the outputs of both the collaborative and content-based models. This hybrid approach improves prediction accuracy and provides more diverse and novel recommendations.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for the project.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and feature engineering.
* **Scikit-learn:** For implementing the machine learning models.
* **Core Concepts:** Recommender Systems, Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Heuristic Analysis.
